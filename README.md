# Authorship-attribution-Bangla
I used python to scrape the author name and story texts from a blog called "Somewhereinblog". It is intended for research purpose

Used Beautifulsoup.
The CSV file contains the scraped contents

After web scraping, I cleaned the data, using the data I performed NLP techniques and predicted the author of the writings.

The .ipynb file contains the Google Colab notebook. And .py file contains the relevant python codes.
